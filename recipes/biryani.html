        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice in cold water then leave to soak and set aside</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan bring a pot of water to a boil then drain the rice and add to the pan before giving it a stir to spread the rice in the pan</li>
            <li>Allow the rice to gently simmer for 12-15 minutes until 80% cooked – at this point the rice grains should have expanded but they will still be relatively hard</li>
            <li>As the rice is cooking in a large pan heat up the oil on medium heat until hot</li>
            <li>Add the bay leaves, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, black cardamom, and green cardamoms then sauté the whole spices for 1 minutes until fragrant</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chicken, the finely diced onions and the chopped tomatoes then cook for 3-4 minutes until the onions are soft and translucent in colour</li>
            <li>Add the ginger paste, garlic paste, garam masala, chilli powder, black pepper, turmeric powder, and salt then cook the spices for 5-7 minutes</li>
            <li>As the spices are cooking peel the potatoes and cut into bite-size chunks then add into pan and cook for 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the yoghurt and stir immediately to prevent it from curdling then cook for 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the cumin seeds, green chillies, fried onions, and coriander then mix</li>
            <li>Drain the parboiled rice and layer on top of the chicken masala followed by some fried onions and finely chopped fresh coriander</li>
            <li>Cover with a lid then reduce the heat to low and allow to cook for 10-12 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and gently mix the chicken masala and rice together – ensure that you mix slowly to not mush the rice</li>
            <li>Serve immediately on its own or alongside some raita!</li>
        </ol>
