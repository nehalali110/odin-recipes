So basically I was wondering for a full stack development bootcamp since then I discovered the odin project.A perfect career path for beginners to build their careers in web development by actually building some cool projects and actually get a job.

This was my first Odin project of basic HTML.In this project we have a base  index file which contains some links to recipe pages. Each of the recipe page contains some info in it including heading image description ingredients and instructions.
